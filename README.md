# **Tap Room 2**

#### By Sean McDermott

## Description
* This is our week one code review for the React portion of our course. The goal of this review is to take a previous project we made in angular and clone a static version that includes client-side routing, styling with css objects/modules, propTypes, and components for modular UI elements.


## Specifications

### Completed
* Successfully implemented Client-Side routing.
* Successfully styled with CSS objects and modules.
* Successfully used propTypes and JSX Looping.
* Created modular components for a slightly modular UI.


## Setup/Installation Requirements

* To view project code, _clone repository from_ https://github.com/seanulus/tap-room-react
* Install Node.js
* Open terminal, navigate to project root directory and run npm install.



## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Notes
